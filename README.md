#### Keep in mind

- Increase your speed – Use lower case characters!
- Repeat the vitals (call sign, RST) three times, but not during a contest
- Transmit symbols before your callsign to prevent wrong reading, especially in bad conditions  
  `***<their-call> <their-call> de <your-callsign> <your-callsign>'`
